This innovative project combines the magic of gestures with the power of computer vision to solve mathematical problems in real-time. Users can draw equations in the air with their fingers, and the system uses AI-powered computer vision to recognize the gestures, interpret the equations, and provide instant solutions. From simple algebra to complex calculus, this tool transforms the way we interact with math, offering an intuitive, hands-free experience.

Key Features:

Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Detects and interprets hand movements for mathematical problem-solving.
AI-Driven Solutions: Utilizes machine learning models to process gestures and solve equations accurately.
Interactive Experience: A fun and engaging way to visualize and solve math problems with minimal tools.
This project bridges the gap between mathematics and technology, inspiring a deeper fascination for both fields while showcasing the potential of gesture-based computing.
